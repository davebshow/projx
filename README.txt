projx - Graph transformations in Python
=======================================

**alpha**

**projx** provides a simple and extensible API for interacting with graphs in Python. Its core functionality is built around making graph transformations using the NetworkX module and a DSL based on Neo4j's Cypher query language. It also provides an extensible ETL pipeline that uses JSON configuration (roughly modeled after orientdb-etl) to translate graph data between various persistent and in-memory representations.
