projx - Graph transformations in Python
=======================================

**Alpha Version API breaking changes may occur over the next several months.**  

projx provides two ways to interact with graphs: 
- A DSL based on Neo4j Cypher for executing graph transformations using a Python DB like API. 
- A programmatic api that consumes JSON ETL configuration objects and executes graph transformations. Based on orientdb-etl.  

Currently only supports networkx.Graph  

- Example Notebook: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/davebshow/projx/blob/master/projx_demo.ipynb   

- Real docs coming soon at: http://projx.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#
